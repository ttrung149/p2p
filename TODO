Baseline features
-----------------
1. Functional index server and peer nodes:
    - Peer node and index server can handle multiple requests. (o)
    - Peer nodes can register files to the index server.       (o)
    - Peer nodes can download files from other peers.          (o)

2. File integrity is not compromised:
    - Index server reaches out to seeder peers to make sure that the file being 
      registered exists before registering in the system.      (o)
    - Peer nodes compare downloaded files to the original hash to ensure they
      were not tampered.                                       (x)

3. Reporting mechanism:
    - Auto report to index server when seeder peer is down     (x)

4. Logging tools                                               (x)
5. Index server caching layer                                  (x)
6. Clear design patterns
    - Socket abstraction                                       (o)
    - Formatted documentations, following C++ coding standards, etc.  (o)

Above and beyonds
-----------------
1. Rate limiting features:
    - Reward seeders with more bandwidth (need more research on 
      how to implement)                                        (x)

2. IP black-listing                                            (x)

3. File segmentation:
    - Divide seeder file into small message chunk              (o)
    - Implement an algorithm (maybe randomized?) to select seeder 
      peers for each chunk.                                    (x)
